INSTRUCTIONS:

the user can see and edit documents by selecting the side panel 'manage signatures'

users can click on a row which will bring up a preview of the document. The user
can thenselect to edit the document by clicking the edit button under the preview.
The user will then enter the edit mode where the user can edit the document then
save the document.

The user will see a success message after successively editing and saving the
docuement.

In the rows that are displayed a user can see what docs have been approved under
the 'Approved' column in the Kendo Grid.

Admins can approve docs under the side panel called 'Documents Panel'. Just like
editing documents, an Admin can approve a document by first selecting the document
in the Kendo Grid by clicking the document row then clicking on the button underneath
the document preview, of the document that needs to be approved.

Once an Admin has approved all docs no docs will appear in the Kendo Grid because
all docs have been approved.

All Kendo Grids can be paged and sorted.
